module ChefVaultItem
  # This is a nice helper method for the Chef Recipe DSL so you can
  # write:
  #   chef_vault_item("secrets", "dbpassword")
  # Instead of:
  #   ChefVault::Item.load("secrets", "dbpassword")
  #
  # Falls back to normal data bag item loading if the item isn't actually a
  # vault item.
