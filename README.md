chef-vault Cookbook
===================

This cookbook is responsible for installing the `chef-vault` gem and
providing some helper methods to load encrypted data bags that are in
The Vault.

Chef Vault is a library by Nordstrom's infrastructure operations team
that helps manage encrypted data bags.

* https://github.com/Nordstrom/chef-vault

## Requirements

This cookbook should work on any system/platform that is supported by
Chef.

## Helper Method

This cookbook provides a nice helper method for the Chef Recipe DSL so
you can write:

    chef_vault_item("secrets", "dbpassword")

Instead of:

    ChefVault::Item.load("secrets", "dbpassword")

This has logic to allow for development and testing of recipes, see
__Attributes__ below.

## Attributes

* `node['chef-vault']['version']` - Specify a version of the
  chef-vault gem if required. Default is `nil`, so the latest version
  will be installed.

The following attribute is special and not specifically related to
this cookbook, but is used in the helper.

* `node['dev_mode']` - If this is true, `chef_vault_item` will attempt
  to load the specified item as a regular Data Bag Item with
  `Chef::DataBagItem.load`. This is intended to be used only for
  testing, and not as a fall back to avoid issues loading encrypted
  items.

* `node['disable_chef_vault']` - If this is true, `chef_vault_item` will attempt
  to load the specified item as an Encrypted Data Bag Item with
  `Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load`. This is intended to allow both usages of 
  encrypted data bags with one solution.

## Usage

Include the recipe before using the Chef Vault library in recipes.

    include_recipe 'chef-vault'
    secret_stuff = ChefVault::Item.load("secrets", "a_secret")

Or, use the helper library method:

    secret_stuff = chef_vault_item("secrets", "a_secret")

If you need a specific version of the `chef-vault` RubyGem, then
specify it with the attribute, `node['chef-vault']['version']`.
